# RNN_Emma
An RNN is used to generate text akin to that found in the text "Emma"

#RNN_Emma
This takes characters as input RNN

#RNN_Emma_Words
This takes words as input into RNN

RNN_Emma_Words produces better results than RNN_Emma but the model takes significantly longer to train

It should be noted that the results produced by 'non-intelligent' Markov Analysis are significantly more readable than both RNN solutions
